Hi! Everyone ! Welcome !
python script learning for system admin tasks and automation

Below is the Syllabus:-
---------------------


Chapter 1: Python Basics
Topics: Data types, variables, operators, conditionals (if, elif, else), and loops (for, while).
Project: System Health Checker – A simple script to simulate CPU, memory, and disk health checks, printing a "healthy" or "alert" status based on threshold values.


Chapter 2: Functions and Modules
Topics: Functions, scope, modules, and libraries (intro to os, sys, and platform for system operations).
Project: Automated Log Organizer – A script to organize log files into folders by date, which could help simplify log analysis.


Chapter 3: File Handling
Topics: Reading/writing files, handling CSV and JSON, file paths, exception handling.
Project: Log Analyzer – A script to parse log files, extract specific information (e.g., error messages), and save it in a structured format like JSON or CSV.


Chapter 4: Working with APIs
Topics: HTTP requests, handling API responses (JSON), API authentication.
Project: API Status Monitor – A script to monitor the status of a list of APIs, logging responses and alerting if any return an error.


Chapter 5: Data Structures
Topics: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, list comprehension.
Project: Configuration Manager – A tool that stores server configuration details (like IP, hostname, status) in structured data formats (e.g., lists and dictionaries), allowing easy updates and retrieval.


Chapter 6: Error Handling and Logging
Topics: Exception handling (try, except, finally), logging with Python’s logging module.
Project: Enhanced Health Checker – Improve the health checker with logging and error handling for better traceability and fault tolerance.


Chapter 7: Regular Expressions
Topics: Basic regex, extracting patterns, validating inputs (IP addresses, email).
Project: Log Scraper – A script that scans log files for specific patterns, such as IP addresses or error codes, and stores matched entries.


Chapter 8: Automation with Python
Topics: Scheduling tasks, using Python with cron jobs (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows), executing shell commands with subprocess.
Project: Automated Backup Script – A script that automates backing up files from one directory to another, compresses them, and optionally emails a report.


Chapter 9: Networking and Sockets
Topics: Working with IPs and hostnames, basic socket programming.
Project: Port Scanner – A basic scanner to check if specific ports on a list of servers are open, useful for basic network troubleshooting.


Chapter 10: Python for Cloud and DevOps Tools
Topics: Intro to using Python with AWS (boto3), Docker (Docker SDK), and Kubernetes (kubernetes-client).
Project: AWS Resource Monitor – A script to fetch and log details of EC2 instances, such as status and IPs, helping track cloud infrastructure.
