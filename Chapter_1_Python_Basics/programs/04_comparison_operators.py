# Comparison Operators Example

a = 10
b = 5

print("a =", a, "b =", b)
print("a == b:", a == b)      # Equal to
print("a != b:", a != b)      # Not equal to
print("a > b:", a > b)        # Greater than
print("a < b:", a < b)        # Less than
print("a >= b:", a >= b)      # Greater than or equal to
print("a <= b:", a <= b)      # Less than or equal to
